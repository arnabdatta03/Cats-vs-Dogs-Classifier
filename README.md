# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classifier
This is a CNN based machine learning model where we classified cats and dogs...

This Model is for dogs and cats image classification purpose only ..

here we used kaggle API key data set we do not download the heavy data set so that we use dataset APi
 The Api is those data set is ->  kaggle datasets download -d salader/dogs-vs-cats
 To run this api key download you first of all run this porsion of code -> !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/

In This project we use platfrom Google Colab and need to help of advanced python and also be many others python library 

In this  project we Basically used CNN Model And predict our model with the help of tranning dataset our accuraccy will be max to max 90%
 and it predict will be more accurate 

 so i tell all of you guyess run this code in your system with maintain all setup composition and rate this project .. your rating will be help me and also if any mistake will be contain is this code infrom me via my portfollio .....
                                                          Thank You
